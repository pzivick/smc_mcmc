Hey Paul, 
See the attached files that have the particle data for the SMC star particles at the present day for Models 1 and 2. 
Columns are x,y,z coordinate of position or velocity as indicated.  These are Galactocentric cartesian coords, where the MW is at (0,0,0) with 0 velocities. 

The SMC is centroid (pretty sure) is at :
Model 1  (xyz) =18.0, -45.7, -40.0 ; (vx,vy,vz) =   -87.8    -384.0      245.6
Model 2 (xyz) = 5.5, -35.1, -39,2; (vx, vy, vz) = -66.1680     -257.657      197.569
So you will need to re-center the particle positions and also re-center the velocities to get in the SMC frame of reference 

Mass per star particle is ~2600 Msun

With regards to the SMC paper - yes the main idea is to look at the internal rotation in Model 2 and in Model 1 in both the gas and star particles.  I don't have a particular timeline in mind, but if it makes sense to start using the SMC sims to compare to datasets then we should probably write this paper sooner rather than later. 

Happy to meet to discuss - my schedule is pretty messed up until week of 31st -- might sometime on June 1 or June 3 work?
